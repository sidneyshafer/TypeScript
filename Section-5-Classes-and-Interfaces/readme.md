# Section 5 - Classes and Interfaces

## What is Object Oriented Programming (OOP)?
* Work with (real-life) entities in your code.

**Objects & Classes**
* Objects - *"The things you work with in code"*
    * **Instances** of classes (based on classes)
    * Class-based creation is an alternative to using object literals.
* Classes - *"Blueprints for objects" (theoretical definition)"*
    * Define how objects look like, which properties and methods they have.
    * Classes make creation of multiple, similar objects much easier.
