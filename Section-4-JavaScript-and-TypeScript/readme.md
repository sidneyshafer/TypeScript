## JavaScript - Declaring Variables

In JavaScript, `var`, `let`, and `const` are used to declare variables, but they differ in their scope and reassignment behavior.

**var**
* Limited to global or function scope. 
* The variable is accessible within the function it's declared in, or globally if declared outside any function. 
* Variable can be reassigned or changed.

**let**
* The variable is only accessible within the block it's declared in (block-scoped).
* Better practice to use `let` over `var`.
* Variable can be reassigned or changed.

**const**
* The variable is only accessible within the block it's declared in (block-scoped).
* Variable cannot be reassigned or changed.
