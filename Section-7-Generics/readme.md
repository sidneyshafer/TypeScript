In TypeScript, generics allow you to write reusable code that can work with a variety of types. More information on generics can be found on the **:link: [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html)**.

## Concepts Include:

* Built-in Generics
* Creating a Generic Function
